A prototype for an app that serves as a data-privacy information hub 

## Description

Created using [Create-React-app](https://create-react-app.dev/). Built using ReactJS, express, NodeJS, and PostgresSQL

MY FIRST PROJECT!! Datalink is a full stack webapp, with hopes of being a one stop all for data privacy for organizations and individuals. Currently, it's pretty barebones, but looking forward to building!!

Features:
 - Cookie report -> Search a website and recieve a web tracking report regarding how safe its cookies are with your data

Future features:
 - Organizations:
     - Phising/scam email message board -> Warn others in your organization about suspicious emails
     - WebReport -> get a review of the most dangerous websites visited by users in your organization
     - Website check -> check that your organizations websites are protecting users data
 - Indivdual:
    - Cookie guard -> Set your cookie preferences once and have datalink automatically disable unnessecary or dangerous cookies on any website you vist
    - blogs -> blogs about best practices for protecting your identity online

## Getting Started

This project is currently very dependent on my local machine and not ready for outside use. In the future, I will migrate database, and backend to a Web Server.
